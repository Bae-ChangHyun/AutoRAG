# Web Interface

## Running the Web Interface
As mentioned in the tutorial, you can run the web interface following the below command:

```bash
streamlit run ./autorag/web.py -- --yaml_path your/path/to/pipeline.yaml
```

```{admonition} Want to specify project folder?
You can specify project directory with `--project_dir` option or project_dir parameter.
```

### Web Interface example

You can use the web interface to interact with the AutoRAG pipeline. The web interface provides a user-friendly environment to input queries and receive responses from the pipeline. The web interface is a convenient way to test the pipeline and observe its performance in real-time.
