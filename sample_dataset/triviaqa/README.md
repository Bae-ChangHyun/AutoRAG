# TriviaQA Dataset Handling

The TriviaQA dataset includes a `corpus.parquet` file that is significantly large and cannot be uploaded directly to Git due to size limitations. To manage this, we have developed a Python script named `load_triviaqa_corpus.py` that facilitates the loading of this corpus file efficiently.
